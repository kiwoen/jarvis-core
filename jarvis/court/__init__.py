"""
Imperial Court System (朝堂系统) — multi-agent deliberation architecture.

The Court is a microcosm of a Chinese imperial court: the Emperor (天子)
receives petitions (user intents), analyzes them, and dispatches edicts
to specialized Ministers (大臣). Each Minister is modeled after a real
world-class AI, embodying its specific strengths. Ministers deliberate
independently (parallel), submit memorials (reports), and the Emperor
synthesizes the final decree.

Key roles:
    丞相 (Chancellor)     — GPT-style general reasoning & task decomposition
    御史大夫 (Grand Censor) — Claude-style long-text review & safety compliance
    太史令 (Grand Historian) — Perplexity-style real-time search & fact-checking
    工部尚书 (Works Minister) — DeepSeek-style code engineering & debugging
    太常 (Ceremonies)      — Gemini-style multimodal understanding
    大司农 (Finance)       — cost optimization & resource management
    太卜 (Grand Diviner)   — scientific reasoning & complex prediction
    卫尉 (Guard Captain)   — security auditing & privacy protection

Evolution: each minister self-evolves through experience — adjusting
confidence baselines, internal temperature, and capability profiles
based on dispatch outcomes and external feedback.
